            In this last case, I discuss my strategy to outreach as a liaison librarian in 2018-2019, when I served as a librarian to the departments of biological sciences, chemistry & biochemistry and computer science at the University of Windsor. To me, outreach and engagement with library user communities is the single most important aspect of my job and is the base from which all my work starts. I describe how I do outreach and the resulting outcomes from my efforts.

        <h3>What happened</h3>
        <p>
          Upon arrival at the University of Windsor, I set up introductory interviews with the heads of the departments to which I was assigned as the liaison librarian. In these departments, knowledge of library services and existing partnerships was minimal. With faculty members unaware of the ways that the library could support them, forming teaching and research support services would be difficult. In response, I developed a deliberate and sustained outreach campaign for the sciences.

        <p>
          The outreach campaign consisted of three elements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Creation of a campaign brand and advertising materials
          </li>
          <li>
            Social media monitoring
          </li>
          <li>
            Continuous in-person participation in departmental events
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          An advertising campaign was born with a campaign-specific brand. The purpose of the advertising campaign, <i>Science+Leddy Library</i>, was to promote relevant library services to the science community. Audience-specific materials, such as the <i>7 Ways to be a More Efficient Chemist</i> brochures, tied library services and information-seeking practices to activities that chemistry researchers would encounter regularly. Advertising material was distributed to the audiences by mail, in-person during events and posted in science buildings. The <i>Science+Leddy Library</i> campaign included pop-up libraries located in the science buildings in order to introduce myself to science faculty and students. The campaign also included an online component, with social media posts and a webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using Twitter, I closely monitored the social media accounts of relevant people in order to make connections and to identify events and opportunities. I followed every faculty member in my departments, graduate students and related student groups and associations. I also made a point of following professional organizations and academic journals in these disciplines, in order to stay in the loop with developments in these fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, there was continuous in-person participation in departmental events. I made an effort to attend at least one departmental research seminar every week, and after identifying opportunities in social media or through faculty newsletters, I would attend special events. At these events, I would make introductions to faculty members, ask students about their information needs and experiences with library services, and learn about the research and scholarship in these disciplines.

        <h3>So what?</h3>
        <p>
          These sustained outreach efforts over the course of two semesters resulted in a number of direct outcomes. As a result of meeting undergraduate and graduate students at pop-up libraries, during departmental events, or through the brochures that I mailed to them, I began to see more students coming to see me for reference interviews. Amongst these students, I met Sarah and Ellyn, graduate students in biology. I have worked with them over the course of the summer to develop a series of relevant data workshops on R and Python, and am working with them to launch a peer-to-peer in-person and virtual study group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another direct outcome of these outreach efforts was a collaboration with the Walpole Island First Nation. During a biology departmental seminar, I met the conservation officer for the Walpole Island Heritage Centre. We spoke about the role of libraries in 2019 and the work that we do with digitization and preservation of digital data. Through this conversation, we identified an opportunity for partnership on a project to digitize a number of analog audio and visual recordings of indigenous culture and environment at Walpole Island. This past summer I, along with colleagues at Leddy Library’s Centre for Digital Scholarship, partnered with the heritage centre to develop a project proposal and to submit an application to a <a href="http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/aboriginal-heritage/initiatives/listen/Pages/funding1.aspx" target="_blank">Library and Archives Canada funding grant</a> for $100,000. We are awaiting the outcome of our application.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been able to make introductions with a number of faculty members in these departments over the year. Initially, I was unable to deliver information literacy instruction in courses. However, through my networking and relationship building with faculty throughout the semester, I have secured future collaborations with courses in the biology and chemistry departments for the 2019-2020 academic year.
        </p>
        <p>
          These direct outcomes would not have been possible without this sustained outreach effort, or more specifically, without the relationship building that took place through the outreach. Libraries are <i>people institutions</i>. Our role is to serve the information needs of the communities that we work with. In order to build a learner-centred library—or campus—one must be visible and one must build relationships. Proactive efforts to meet and learn about our learners is fundamental work in my practice of librarianship.

        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <p>
          Looking ahead to the upcoming academic year and beyond, I will continue to sustain my outreach efforts. Attendance in-person at departmental events was particularly effective, and I plan on continuing this with my departments this year. This summer I have expanded my outreach to include a survey for graduate students in my departments, in order to capture information on their data skills needs. I will investigate this and other methods of reaching and getting feedback from my users.
        </p>
        <p>
          New departments also provide new opportunities for outreach. I was assigned the role of nursing liaison in 2019-2020 at the University of Windsor. As a result of brief outreach activities during the summer with faculty and graduate students, I identified a gap in reference services for the working graduate students and began to offer virtual reference interviews using Google Hangouts. The nursing program is also collaborative, partnering with local colleges and hospitals to train undergraduate nursing students. I’ve spent time this summer reaching out to other librarians involved with this collaborative program at Windsor Regional Hospital, and will continue to do so in order to better understand the needs of the students and to find available resources.
