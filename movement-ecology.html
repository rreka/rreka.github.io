          In Winter 2019, I partnered with Professor Nigel Hussey at the University of Windsor for his fourth-year undergraduate course on movement ecology. The course explored how organisms move within their ranges. Teams of students engaged in a major project to write—and ultimately submit for publication in a journal—a comprehensive literature review on tracking methods for different species of arctic whales and sharks.

        <h5>The first class</h5>
        <p>I provided an <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hNjBqHnKNZcrTbSJcAQ07aZ8zmP6Ex5mnk_kC9zWCPk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">initial lecture and workshop</a> where I introduced the students to literature reviews: what they are, their fit within the scientific literature and the methods used to conduct systematic reviews. Students were taught how to search for articles using citation indexes, and strategies to find articles not captured in indexes. Finally, students were taught to use citation management software in order to store the references resulting from the searches of multiple databases, remove duplicate references, and to share their collections within the team. We made use of the collaborative features in Google Docs during the first workshop to have the teams develop search strategies, share them with the class, and receive feedback in real-time.</p>
        <h5>The second class</h5
        <p>The class’s first assignment was to develop a preliminary search on each of their topics relating to methods of satellite tagging of sharks or whales, using the information from the workshop. I reviewed the searches before the next class and provided feedback. During the second class, each team presented their preliminary searches to the rest of the class. Peers had the first opportunity to provide feedback on search strategies. I then provided feedback from my own review of each teams’ search. We spent the rest of this class developing search strategies for multiple bibliographic indexes and answering questions on search technique, downloading references and de-duplication of references. Students were to come to the third class with a complete search and a final, de-duplicated set of references.</p>
        <h5>The third class</h5
        <p>During the third and final class in which I was involved, I instructed on the processes of screening and data extraction in systematic reviews. Grounded in the context of transparency and reproducibility of searches, I showed students how to screen their references for relevant articles, while minimizing biases in including studies. I developed a <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U299FFJiasiH_vhNUu7gUpX36mTyVCRw?usp=sharing" target="_blank">data screening and extraction process and tools</a> for the teams. Using the process and tools, students had a framework to guide them in independently screening all references for inclusion in the review, resolving conflicts between reviewers, and extracting the data from the full-text articles.</p>

        <p>The movement ecology class used a Slack workspace as the class website and as a collaboration tool. All teams had a channel within the workspace to discuss progress on the projects. I was added to the Slack workspace and all channels to provide support throughout the entire class. During the semester I regularly gave reference support for the students directly in Slack.</p>

        <h3>So what?</h3>
        <p>
          As with all of my teaching and learning, I aim to ground my work within the larger contexts of information literacy and disciplinary themes (in this particular case, reproducibility). The <a href="http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/ilframework" target="_blank"><i>ACRL’s Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education</i></a> is the starting point for all of my instruction. Due to the importance of the literature review in this course, I focused on the ‘scholarship as conversation’ frame. I took the time to explain to students the role of this particular form of information in the scientific literature. I used this theme to impress upon the students their responsibilities as contributors to the scientific discourse, to stress that they conduct their work ethically in a manner that minimizes biases that are inherent with this form of research.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result of my experience working with comprehensive forms of evidence synthesis in medicine and the health sciences, I am acutely aware of the growing concerns around reporting and reproducibility of systematic reviews. During the initial workshop, I lectured on the issues in the reproducibility of systematic reviews in the medical sciences, and the <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/" target="_blank">response of the scientific community</a> to these issues. Students were taught how to report their work in order to ensure proper transparency of their methodology. The data screening and extraction tools that I developed for teams are designed to keep a record of the decision making during the screening process, which is critical for the transparency of methodology in the final report.
        </p>

        <p>
          As with the teaching that I do with the military for the cadet program, my teaching style in librarianship is learned-centred. Instead of lecturing as the sole-voice, I strive to facilitate learning through participation and engagement from the learners. I vary the instructional methods during the lesson in order to match the content that is being taught with the most appropriate teaching technique. An interactive lecture method was used predominantly during the initial lesson when theoretical knowledge had to be transferred. At all opportunities, questions were posed to the students to engage them in the content and to confirm their learning. Activities were used during the lessons in order to give students the opportunity to practice the skills they are being taught. For example, as I was teaching students about minimal concepts in search strategy design, I asked students to begin forming their own searches in the shared Google Doc.
        </p>

        <p>
          The instruction presented in this case was the result of team-approach in designing the lessons and activities between the professor and the librarian. Connecting the material to concepts in information literacy, evidence synthesis, and reproducibility helped to enrich the student’s learning experience. The use of a variety of instructional methods, and of collaborative technology (e.g., Google Docs, Slack) facilitated an active learning environment. The application of traditional librarian reference service to an online environment with Slack provided students with direct access to their librarian at the point-of-need. This approach was well-received by both the professor and the students. I have been invited to participate in the course again in Winter 2020. As a result of this instruction, students in the course invited me to give a similar workshop to a research lab, and to a high school outreach program.

        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <p>
          While I believe that this particular approach to information literacy has been successful, there is still work that has to be done. The movement ecology course is an optional fourth-year course in the Department of Integrative Biology. Most students are not currently exposed to information literacy instruction in this program at the University of Windsor. I am interested in building a scaffolded, and programmatic approach to information literacy in teaching programs. This requires specific information literacy interventions throughout the undergraduate program, which do not yet exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been able to take the results of this particular case to the instructors of the required, lower-year courses, as evidence of the success of this type of instruction. By doing so, I will be collaborating with instructors for the second-year required ecology class to develop a lab on information literacy. These are small steps towards the final goal of scaffolded information literacy instruction, but building trust amongst faculty and showing results is a necessary part of this process. I am currently also investigating other options for building curriculum-based information literacy, such as curriculum mapping.
